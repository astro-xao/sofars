///  Notes:
///
///  1) The TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
///     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
///     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
///     others:
///  ```
///            date1          date2
///
///         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
///         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
///         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
///         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
///  ```
///     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
///     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
///     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
///     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
///     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
///     good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
///     applications of this function the choice will not be at all
///     critical.
///
///     TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
///     accuracy.
///
///  2) The vectors eb, eh, and all the astrom vectors, are with respect
///     to BCRS axes.
///
///  3) The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
///     reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN
///     CONVENTION:  the longitude required by the present function is
///     right-handed, i.e. east-positive, in accordance with geographical
///     convention.
///
///     The adjusted longitude stored in the astrom array takes into
///     account the TIO locator and polar motion.
///
///  4) xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
///     Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
///     Reference System (see IERS Conventions), measured along the
///     meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  sp is the TIO locator
///     s', in radians, which positions the Terrestrial Intermediate
///     Origin on the equator.  For many applications, xp, yp and
///     (especially) sp can be set to zero.
///
///     Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto the
///     local meridian.
///
///  5) The refraction constants refa and refb are for use in a
///     dZ = A*tan(Z)+B*tan^3(Z) model, where Z is the observed
///     (i.e. refracted) zenith distance and dZ is the amount of
///     refraction.
///
///  6) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
///     values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
///     accordance with the models used.
///
///  7) In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
///     Ephemeris, the Earth rotation information and refraction
///     constants, the function iauApco13 can be used instead of the
///     present function.  This starts from UTC and weather readings etc.
///     and computes suitable values using other SOFA functions.
///
///  8) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
///     structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
///     astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
///
///     The various functions support different classes of observer and
///     portions of the transformation chain:
///     ```
///          functions         observer        transformation
///
///       iauApcg iauApcg13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
///       iauApci iauApci13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
///       iauApco iauApco13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
///       iauApcs iauApcs13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
///       iauAper iauAper13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
///       iauApio iauApio13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
///     ```
///     Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
///     compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
///     supplied by the caller.
///
///     The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
///     parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
///     comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
///     observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
///     aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
///     transformation), and atmospheric refraction.
///
///  9) The context structure astrom produced by this function is used by
///     iauAtioq, iauAtoiq, iauAtciq* and iauAticq*.
///
///  Called:
///  ```
///     iauIr        initialize r-matrix to identity
///     iauRz        rotate around Z-axis
///     iauRy        rotate around Y-axis
///     iauRx        rotate around X-axis
///     iauAnpm      normalize angle into range +/- pi
///     iauC2ixys    celestial-to-intermediate matrix, given X,Y and s
