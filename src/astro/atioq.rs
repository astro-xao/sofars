///     dob    double*    observed declination (radians)
///     rob    double*    observed right ascension (CIO-based, radians)
///  ```
///  Notes:
///
///  1) This function returns zenith distance rather than altitude in
///     order to reflect the fact that no allowance is made for
///     depression of the horizon.
///
///  2) The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
///     refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
///     Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and
///     there are no gross local effects, the predicted observed
///     coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec
///     (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better
///     than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better
///     than 20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.
///
///     Without refraction, the complementary functions iauAtioq and
///     iauAtoiq are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond all
///     over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included, consistency
///     falls off at high zenith distances, but is still better than
///     0.05 arcsec at 85 degrees.
///
///  3) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
///     values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
///     accordance with the models used.
///
///  4) The CIRS RA,Dec is obtained from a star catalog mean place by
///     allowing for space motion, parallax, the Sun's gravitational lens
///     effect, annual aberration and precession-nutation.  For star
///     positions in the ICRS, these effects can be applied by means of
///     the iauAtci13 (etc.) functions.  Starting from classical "mean
///     place" systems, additional transformations will be needed first.
///
///  5) "Observed" Az,El means the position that would be seen by a
///     perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  This is obtained from
///     the CIRS RA,Dec by allowing for Earth orientation and diurnal
///     aberration, rotating from equator to horizon coordinates, and
///     then adjusting for refraction.  The HA,Dec is obtained by
///     rotating back into equatorial coordinates, and is the position
///     that would be seen by a perfect equatorial with its polar axis
///     aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.  Finally, the
///     (CIO-based) RA is obtained by subtracting the HA from the local
///     ERA.
///
///  6) The star-independent CIRS-to-observed-place parameters in ASTROM
///     may be computed with iauApio[13] or iauApco[13].  If nothing has
///     changed significantly except the time, iauAper[13] may be used to
///     perform the requisite adjustment to the astrom structure.
///
///  Called:
///  ```
///     iauS2c       spherical coordinates to unit vector
///     iauC2s       p-vector to spherical
///     iauAnp       normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi
