///  Quick CIRS âˆ’> ICRS

///  Quick CIRS RA,Dec to ICRS astrometric place, given the star-
///  independent astrometry parameters.
///
///  Use of this function is appropriate when efficiency is important and
///  where many star positions are all to be transformed for one date.
///  The star-independent astrometry parameters can be obtained by
///  calling one of the functions iauApci[13], iauApcg[13], iauApco[13]
///  or iauApcs[13].
///
///  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
///  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
///
///  Status:  support function.
///
///  Given:
///     ri,di  double     CIRS RA,Dec (radians)
///     astrom iauASTROM* star-independent astrometry parameters:
///      pmt    double       PM time interval (SSB, Julian years)
///      eb     double[3]    SSB to observer (vector, au)
///      eh     double[3]    Sun to observer (unit vector)
///      em     double       distance from Sun to observer (au)
///      v      double[3]    barycentric observer velocity (vector, c)
///      bm1    double       sqrt(1-|v|^2): reciprocal of Lorenz factor
///      bpn    double[3][3] bias-precession-nutation matrix
///      along  double       longitude + s' (radians)
///      xpl    double       polar motion xp wrt local meridian (radians)
///      ypl    double       polar motion yp wrt local meridian (radians)
///      sphi   double       sine of geodetic latitude
///      cphi   double       cosine of geodetic latitude
///      diurab double       magnitude of diurnal aberration vector
///      eral   double       "local" Earth rotation angle (radians)
///      refa   double       refraction constant A (radians)
///      refb   double       refraction constant B (radians)
///
///  Returned:
///     rc,dc  double     ICRS astrometric RA,Dec (radians)
///
///  Notes:
///
///  1) Only the Sun is taken into account in the light deflection
///     correction.
///
///  2) Iterative techniques are used for the aberration and light
///     deflection corrections so that the functions iauAtic13 (or
///     iauAticq) and iauAtci13 (or iauAtciq) are accurate inverses;
///     even at the edge of the Sun's disk the discrepancy is only about
///     1 nanoarcsecond.
