///
///  Use of this function is appropriate when efficiency is important and

///  The star-independent astrometry parameters can be obtained by
///  calling one of the functions iauApci[13], iauApcg[13], iauApco[13]
///  or iauApcs[13].
///
///  If the only light-deflecting body to be taken into account is the
///  Sun, the iauAticq function can be used instead.

///  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
///  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.

///     astrom iauASTROM*  star-independent astrometry parameters:
///      pmt    double       PM time interval (SSB, Julian years)

///  Returned:
///  ```
///     rc,dc  double     ICRS astrometric RA,Dec (radians)
///  ```
///  Notes:
///
///  1) Iterative techniques are used for the aberration and light
///     deflection corrections so that the functions iauAticqn and
///     iauAtciqn are accurate inverses; even at the edge of the Sun's
///     disk the discrepancy is only about 1 nanoarcsecond.
///
///  2) If the only light-deflecting body to be taken into account is the
///     Sun, the iauAticq function can be used instead.
///
///  3) The struct b contains n entries, one for each body to be
///     considered.  If n = 0, no gravitational light deflection will be
///     applied, not even for the Sun.
///
///  4) The struct b should include an entry for the Sun as well as for
///     any planet or other body to be taken into account.  The entries
///     should be in the order in which the light passes the body.
///
///  5) In the entry in the b struct for body i, the mass parameter
///     b[i].bm can, as required, be adjusted in order to allow for such
///     effects as quadrupole field.
///
///  6) The deflection limiter parameter b[i].dl is phi^2/2, where phi is
///     the angular separation (in radians) between star and body at
///     which limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen
///     threshold, the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero
///     for phi = 0.   Example values suitable for a terrestrial
///     observer, together with masses, are as follows:
///  ```
///        body i     b[i].bm        b[i].dl
///
///        Sun        1.0            6e-6
///        Jupiter    0.00095435     3e-9
///        Saturn     0.00028574     3e-10
///  ```
///  7) For efficiency, validation of the contents of the b array is
///     omitted.  The supplied masses must be greater than zero, the
///     position and velocity vectors must be right, and the deflection
///     limiter greater than zero.
///
///  Called:
///  ```
///     iauS2c       spherical coordinates to unit vector
