///  Proper motion and parallax.
///
///  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
///  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
///
///  Status:  support function.
///
///  Given:
///  ```
///     rc,dc  double     ICRS RA,Dec at catalog epoch (radians)
///     pr     double     RA proper motion (radians/year, Note 1)
///     pd     double     Dec proper motion (radians/year)
///     px     double     parallax (arcsec)
///     rv     double     radial velocity (km/s, +ve if receding)
///     pmt    double     proper motion time interval (SSB, Julian years)
///     pob    double[3]  SSB to observer vector (au)
///  ```
///  Returned:
///  ```
///     pco    double[3]  coordinate direction (BCRS unit vector)
///  ```
///  Notes:
///
///  1) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.
///
///  2) The proper motion time interval is for when the starlight
///     reaches the solar system barycenter.
///
///  3) To avoid the need for iteration, the Roemer effect (i.e. the
///     small annual modulation of the proper motion coming from the
///     changing light time) is applied approximately, using the
///     direction of the star at the catalog epoch.
