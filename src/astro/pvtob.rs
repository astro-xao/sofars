///  Observatory position and velocity
///
///  Position and velocity of a terrestrial observing station.
///
///  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
///  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
///
///  Status:  support function.
///
///  Given:
///  ```
///     elong   double       longitude (radians, east +ve, Note 1)
///     phi     double       latitude (geodetic, radians, Note 1)
///     hm      double       height above ref. ellipsoid (geodetic, m)
///     xp,yp   double       coordinates of the pole (radians, Note 2)
///     sp      double       the TIO locator s' (radians, Note 2)
///     theta   double       Earth rotation angle (radians, Note 3)
///  ```
///  Returned:
///  ```
///     pv      double[2][3] position/velocity vector (m, m/s, CIRS)
///  ```
///  Notes:
///
///  1) The terrestrial coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
///     reference ellipsoid.
///
///  2) xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
///     Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
///     Reference System (see IERS Conventions), measured along the
///     meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  sp is the TIO locator
///     s', in radians, which positions the Terrestrial Intermediate
///     Origin on the equator.  For many applications, xp, yp and
///     (especially) sp can be set to zero.
///
///  3) If theta is Greenwich apparent sidereal time instead of Earth
///     rotation angle, the result is with respect to the true equator
///     and equinox of date, i.e. with the x-axis at the equinox rather
///     than the celestial intermediate origin.
///
///  4) The velocity units are meters per UT1 second, not per SI second.
///     This is unlikely to have any practical consequences in the modern
///     era.
///
///  5) No validation is performed on the arguments.  Error cases that
///     could lead to arithmetic exceptions are trapped by the iauGd2gc
///     function, and the result set to zeros.
