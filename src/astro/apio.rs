///  Notes:
///
///  1) sp, the TIO locator s', is a tiny quantity needed only by the
///     most precise applications.  It can either be set to zero or
///     predicted using the SOFA function iauSp00.
///
///  2) The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
///     reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
///     longitude required by the present function is east-positive
///     (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.
///
///  3) The polar motion xp,yp can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
///     values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
///     Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
///     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
///     meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many applications,
///     xp and yp can be set to zero.
///
///     Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto the
///     local meridian.
///
///  4) The refraction constants refa and refb are for use in a
///     dZ = A*tan(Z)+B*tan^3(Z) model, where Z is the observed
///     (i.e. refracted) zenith distance and dZ is the amount of
///     refraction.
///
///  5) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
///     values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
///     accordance with the models used.
///
///  6) In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
///     rotation information and refraction constants, the function
///     iauApio13 can be used instead of the present function.  This
///     starts from UTC and weather readings etc. and computes suitable
///     values using other SOFA functions.
///
///  7) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
///     structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
///     astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
///
///     The various functions support different classes of observer and
///     portions of the transformation chain:
///  ```
///          functions         observer        transformation
///
///       iauApcg iauApcg13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
///       iauApci iauApci13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
///       iauApco iauApco13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
///       iauApcs iauApcs13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
///       iauAper iauAper13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
///       iauApio iauApio13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
///  ```
///     Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
///     compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
///     supplied by the caller.
///
///     The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
///     parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
///     comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
///     observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
///     aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
///     transformation), and atmospheric refraction.
///
///  8) The context structure astrom produced by this function is used by
///     iauAtioq and iauAtoiq.
///
///  Called:
///  ```
///     iauIr        initialize r-matrix to identity
///     iauRz        rotate around Z-axis
///     iauRy        rotate around Y-axis
///     iauRx        rotate around X-axis
///     iauAnpm      normalize angle into range +/- pi
///     iauPvtob     position/velocity of terrestrial station
///  ```
