///  Frame bias components, IAU 2000
///
///  Frame bias components of IAU 2000 precession-nutation models;  part
///  of the Mathews-Herring-Buffett (MHB2000) nutation series, with
///  additions.
///
///  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
///  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
///
///  Status:  canonical model.
///
///  Returned:
///     dpsibi,depsbi  double  longitude and obliquity corrections
///     dra            double  the ICRS RA of the J2000.0 mean equinox
///
///  Notes:
///
///  1) The frame bias corrections in longitude and obliquity (radians)
///     are required in order to correct for the offset between the GCRS
///     pole and the mean J2000.0 pole.  They define, with respect to the
///     GCRS frame, a J2000.0 mean pole that is consistent with the rest
///     of the IAU 2000A precession-nutation model.
///
///  2) In addition to the displacement of the pole, the complete
///     description of the frame bias requires also an offset in right
///     ascension.  This is not part of the IAU 2000A model, and is from
///     Chapront et al. (2002).  It is returned in radians.
///
///  3) This is a supplemented implementation of one aspect of the IAU
///     2000A nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General
///     Assembly in 2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).
