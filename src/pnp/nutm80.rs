///  Form the matrix of nutation for a given date, IAU 1980 model.
///
///  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
///  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
///
///  Status:  support function.
///
///  Given:
///     date1,date2    double          TDB date (Note 1)
///
///  Returned (function value):
///     rmatn          [[f64; 3]; 3]    nutation matrix
///
///  Notes:
///
///  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
///     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
///     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
///     among others:
///
///            date1          date2
///
///         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
///         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
///         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
///         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
///
///     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
///     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
///     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
///     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
///     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
///     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
///
///  2) The matrix operates in the sense V(true) = rmatn * V(mean),
///     where the p-vector V(true) is with respect to the true
///     equatorial triad of date and the p-vector V(mean) is with
///     respect to the mean equatorial triad of date.
///
///  Called:
///     iauNut80     nutation, IAU 1980
