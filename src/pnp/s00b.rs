/// The CIO locator s, positioning the Celestial Intermediate Origin on
/// the equator of the Celestial Intermediate Pole, using the IAU 2000B
/// precession-nutation model.
///
/// This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
/// SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
///
/// Status:  support function.
///
/// Given:
///    date1,date2  f64    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
///
/// Returned (function value):
///                 f64    the CIO locator s in radians (Note 2)
///
/// Notes:
///
/// 1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
///    convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
///    JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
///    among others:
///
/// ```text
///           date1          date2
///
///        2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
///        2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
///        2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
///        2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
/// ```
///
///    The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
///    cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
///    is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
///    the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
///    optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
///    are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
///
/// 2) The CIO locator s is the difference between the right ascensions
///    of the same point in two systems.  The two systems are the GCRS
///    and the CIP,CIO, and the point is the ascending node of the
///    CIP equator.  The CIO locator s remains a small fraction of
///    1 arcsecond throughout 1900-2100.
///
/// 3) The series used to compute s is in fact for s+XY/2, where X and Y
///    are the x and y components of the CIP unit vector;  this series
///    is more compact than a direct series for s would be.  The present
///    function uses the IAU 2000B truncated nutation model when
///    predicting the CIP position.  The function iauS00a uses instead
///    the full IAU 2000A model, but with no significant increase in
///    accuracy and at some cost in speed.
