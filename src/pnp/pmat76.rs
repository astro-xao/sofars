/// Precession matrix from J2000.0 to a specified date, IAU 1976 model.
///
/// This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
/// SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
///
/// Status:  support function.
///
/// Given:
///    date1,date2 f64          ending date, TT (Note 1)
///
/// Returned:
///    rmatp       f64[3][3]    precession matrix, J2000.0 -> date1+date2
///
/// Notes:
///
/// 1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
///    convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
///    JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
///    among others:
///
/// ```text
///           date1          date2
///
///        2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
///        2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
///        2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
///        2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
/// ```
///
///    The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
///    cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
///    is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
///    the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
///    optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
///    are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
///
/// 2) The matrix operates in the sense V(date) = RMATP * V(J2000),
///    where the p-vector V(J2000) is with respect to the mean
///    equatorial triad of epoch J2000.0 and the p-vector V(date)
///    is with respect to the mean equatorial triad of the given
///    date.
///
/// 3) Though the matrix method itself is rigorous, the precession
///    angles are expressed through canonical polynomials which are
///    valid only for a limited time span.  In addition, the IAU 1976
///    precession rate is known to be imperfect.  The absolute accuracy
///    of the present formulation is better than 0.1 arcsec from
///    1960AD to 2040AD, better than 1 arcsec from 1640AD to 2360AD,
///    and remains below 3 arcsec for the whole of the period
///    500BC to 3000AD.  The errors exceed 10 arcsec outside the
///    range 1200BC to 3900AD, exceed 100 arcsec outside 4200BC to
///    5600AD and exceed 1000 arcsec outside 6800BC to 8200AD.
