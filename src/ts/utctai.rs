///  Time scale transformation:  Coordinated Universal Time, UTC, to

///
///  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
///  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
///
///  Status:  canonical.
///
///  Given:
///     utc1,utc2  double   UTC as a 2-part quasi Julian Date (Notes 1-4)
///
///  Returned:
///     tai1,tai2  double   TAI as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 5)
///
///  Returned (function value):
///                int      status: +1 = dubious year (Note 3)
///                                  0 = OK
///                                 -1 = unacceptable date
///
///  Notes:
///
///  1) utc1+utc2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
///     convenient way between the two arguments, for example where utc1
///     is the Julian Day Number and utc2 is the fraction of a day.
///
///  2) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
///     special measures are taken.  The convention in the present
///     function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether the
///     length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era
///     there were smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the
///     linear UTC(TAI) expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps"
///     are also included in the SOFA convention.
///
///  3) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
///     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
///     to be trusted.  See iauDat for further details.
///
///  4) The function iauDtf2d converts from calendar date and time of day
///     into 2-part Julian Date, and in the case of UTC implements the
///     leap-second-ambiguity convention described above.
///
///  5) The returned TAI1,TAI2 are such that their sum is the TAI Julian
///     Date.
///
///  Called:
///     iauJd2cal    JD to Gregorian calendar
