///
///  Format for output a 2-part Julian Date (or in the case of UTC a
///  quasi-JD form that includes special provision for leap seconds).
///
///  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
///  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
///
///  Status:  support function.
///
///  Given:
///  ```
///     scale     char[]  time scale ID (Note 1)
///     ndp       int     resolution (Note 2)
///     d1,d2     double  time as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 3,4)
///  ```
///  Returned:
///  ```
///     iy,im,id  int     year, month, day in Gregorian calendar (Note 5)
///     ihmsf     int[4]  hours, minutes, seconds, fraction (Note 1)
///  ```
///  Returned (function value):
///  ```
///               int     status: +1 = dubious year (Note 5)
///                                0 = OK
///                               -1 = unacceptable date (Note 6)
///  ```
///  Notes:
///
///  1) scale identifies the time scale.  Only the value "UTC" (in upper
///     case) is significant, and enables handling of leap seconds (see
///     Note 4).
///
///  2) ndp is the number of decimal places in the seconds field, and can
///     have negative as well as positive values, such as:
///  ```
///     ndp         resolution
///     -4            1 00 00
///     -3            0 10 00
///     -2            0 01 00
///     -1            0 00 10
///      0            0 00 01
///      1            0 00 00.1
///      2            0 00 00.01
///      3            0 00 00.001
///  ```
///     The limits are platform dependent, but a safe range is -5 to +9.
///
///  3) d1+d2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way between
///     the two arguments, for example where d1 is the Julian Day Number
///     and d2 is the fraction of a day.  In the case of UTC, where the
///     use of JD is problematical, special conventions apply:  see the
///     next note.
///
///  4) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
///     special measures are taken.  The SOFA internal convention is that
///     the quasi-JD day represents UTC days whether the length is 86399,
///     86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era there were
///     smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the linear UTC(TAI)
///     expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps" are also included
///     in the SOFA convention.
///
///  5) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
///     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
///     to be trusted.  See iauDat for further details.
///
///  6) For calendar conventions and limitations, see iauCal2jd.
///
///  Called:
///  ```
///     iauJd2cal    JD to Gregorian calendar
///     iauD2tf      decompose days to hms
///     iauDat       delta(AT) = TAI-UTC
///  ```
